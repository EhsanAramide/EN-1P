# Contributing to EN-1P

Thank you for contributing and welcome to this routine/challenge. I started this routine/challenge as a hobby before sleep if you enjoy, you can join us to practice with together.

Note: Only the `C` programming language is accepted.

## Contributing Process

If you want to contribute to this routine you should do following steps:

1. Open an issue and suggest a problem to solve it with together.
> Please suggest your problem from one of online services like [leetcode](https://leetcode.com). Open your issue before 20:00 (in +3:30 timezone - Tehran) and explain your idea and challenge that you found in that problem. After 20:00 (in +3:30 timezone - Tehran) we start solve the problem until 00:00 then open a pull request and mention the issue to talk about your code.

2. Before opening pull request rename your file to `problem_name_your_username.c`.

3. Every problem has its own directory in `src/`. In that directory you can find `info.json` file open it and if you rather, write your username and add your submissions like the following:
```json
{
...
    "EhsanAramide" : [
        {
            "datetime": "....",
            "runtime": "....",
            "memory": "...."
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Always use [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your commits.

Note: Every problem which is selected, will be pinned in [issues](https://github.com/EhsanAramide/EN-1P/issues).
